# Aloha Project 1

Aloha Apparel is a fully responsive website that is able to scrolls to various sections of the page while clicking on navigation bar. It is also formatted to view in mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- In the header section the website contains company logo in the left, navigation in the middle, and a cart top right. 
- The second section has a banner which required two different background which were controlled using background positioning, sizing, and specifing which image we want to repeat or not. 
- The third section which can be navigated to by clicking shop. 
- Fourth section is the most loved product which as also be scrolled by clicking featured. We used flickity and flex to display so the dress appears by scrolling. 
- Fourth section is the sign-up section that allows shoppers to input their email and subscribe. 
- Lastly the last section contains address and social network links. While hovering the mouse over it color changes to red.

<h1>Journey</h1>
This is the first I have ever created a web-site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has been a very challenging experience especially at a point when i had lost my files and had to restart the project. Since we were taught GitHub and Git I no longer have to worry about it. Furthermore, javascript  makes HTML and CSS look way more simpler in comparison !
